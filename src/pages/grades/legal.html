    <p>
        Most apps would probably have some long article of legal disclaimer written by a team of lawyers which would release them from any liability. However since I am not a lawyer and don’t plan on hiring one just to make this app, this will be very unprofessional. Some may ask why I am even writing a legal section within this app, and to them I ask why not? First off the news events and the pictures they include are NOT owned by myself and belong to their respective owners. The grades served to you are taken from <b>home-access.cfisd.net</b> via HTTPS post requests and are processed through my webserver. These requests <b>use TLS to encrypt</b> your password and are not physically stored except for on your own device. As for the app itself, the code is publically available on <a href="https://github.com/sshh12/CyRanch-App">github.com</a>.
